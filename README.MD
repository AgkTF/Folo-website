## What is this? ðŸ¤”

This is a simple practice project for me that entails taking a mockup and convert it to a working website using the 3 main technologies of the web, **HTML, CSS & JS**.

## Technologies used

1- HTML

2- CSS

3- JavaScript

## Deployment

Again with the amazing **Netlify**.

## Credits

All the credit goes to the beautiful developer and designer community.

Big thank you to [**Raman Yv**](https://dribbble.com/Ramon_Yv). I don't know him at all, but I used his free design so he deserves the mention of course.
